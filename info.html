                              <h3>Some Accomplishments of Stephen Hawking:</h3>
                  
                              <dl>
                                <dt>1. Proved the existence of singularities</dt>
                                <dd>- With the help of English physicist Roger Penrose, Stephan Hawking proved the existence of singularities and theorized that the universe might have begun as a singularity. The Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems attempt to answer when
                                  gravitation produces singularities.</dd><br>
                                <dt>2. Hawking co-discovered the four laws of black hole mechanics</dt>
                                <dd>- With James Bardeen and Brandon Carter, Stephan Hawking discovered the four laws of black hole mechanics. These laws are physical properties that black holes are believed to satisfy and are analogous to the laws of thermodynamics. In January
                                  1971, his essay titled “Black Holes” won the prestigious Gravity Research Foundation Award.</dd><br>
                                <dt>3. His most significant theory is that black holes emit the Hawking radiation</dt>
                                <dd>- Previously physicists believed nothing could escape a black hole. In 1974, Stephan Hawking showed that black holes emit radiation, which may continue till they exhaust their energy and evaporate. Stephen’s prediction of what became known
                                  as the Hawking radiation initially created a controversy but on further research was considered an important breakthrough in theoretical physics.</dd><br>
                                <dt>4. He contributed to the theory of cosmic inflation</dt>
                                <dd>- Introduced by Alan Guth in 1980, cosmic inflation is a theory in physical cosmology which proposes that following the Big Bang, the universe expanded exponentially before settling down to slower expansion. It is now widely accepted. Stephen
                                  Hawking was one of the first to calculate quantum fluctuations that were created during cosmic inflation and to show how they might give rise to the spread of galaxies in the universe.</dd><br>
                                <dt>5. Along with James Hartle, he proposed an important model on universe’s initial state</dt>
                                <dd>- Along with James Hartle, Stephen Hawking published a model known as the Hartle–Hawking state in 1983. It proposed that time didn’t exist before the Big Bang and hence the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless. The Hartle–Hawking
                                  state universe has no beginning as it has no initial boundaries in time or space. It remains one of the most prominent theories on the initial state of the universe.</dd><br>
                                <dt>6. With Thomas Hertog, he proposed a theory of “top-down cosmology”</dt>
                                <dd>- In 2006, Stephen Hawking, along with Thomas Hertog of CERN, proposed a theory of “top-down cosmology”. It proposed that the universe had not one unique initial state but consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions.
                                  Thus as we don’t know the initial conditions at the beginning of the universe, we can’t have a bottom-up model. This leaves the possibility of only a top-down approach as we know the final state of the universe – the one we are in now.
                                  The theory became popular as it fits in with the well-known string theory.</dd><br>
                                <dt>7. Hawking wrote the famous book A Brief History of Time</dt>
                                <dd>- In 1988, Hawking’s book A Brief History of Time was published. In it he explains a range of subjects in cosmology, including the big bang, black holes and light cones. The book was written in a non-technical language to clearly express
                                  his ideas to an average reader. A Brief History of Time became a bestseller and sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years. It appeared on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. It also enhanced Hawking’s
                                  international reputation and media described him as “Master of the Universe”.</dd><br>
